#Processing + Arduino

![Processing](processing-cover.png)


### An experiment to modify a processing sketch with physical controllers plugged through an Arduino board.

Right now the Arduino board uses a *Wii nunchuk* controller instead of the mouse coordinates. You can check it out in the arduino sketch: `Wiichuck-reader > Wiichuck-reader.ino`

##**How does it work?**

The nunchuck is plugged into the arduino, the sketch is loaded on the board..and it will output X and Y coordantes from the joystick to be used insted of mouse coordinates. The arduino board and the Processing sketch communicate throug the serial port.

:pushpin: I will be updating from with more details...
